### Can we do better than MAT?

***

#### Two main questions:

<br>

**1) Does MAT approximate soil temp well across the elevational gradient?**

- If so, this supports using MAT as the baselin soil temp input for MIMICS

<br>

**2) Does MAT align with soil temp differences between local aspects?**

  - Can we show local aspect differences in soil temp?
  
  - Does incoming solar better align with aspect soil temp?
  
    ...if so, supports using incoming solar as adjustment to MAT in MIMICS
